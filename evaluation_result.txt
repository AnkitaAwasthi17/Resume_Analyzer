Evaluation Result:
Based on the provided information, I would rate Alex Johnson's profile as follows:

Skills (7/10): Alex has listed two specific skills - Java and Deep Learning. These are relevant to IT and particularly to Information Technology related to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. However, there is no mention of any other relevant skills such as Python (commonly used in AI/ML), data analysis tools like Excel or R, or experience with cloud platforms for hosting and deploying AI models.

Experience (4/10): Alex's experience primarily consists of building a generative art tool using GANs and participating in various AI/ML hackathons. While this demonstrates an interest and some level of proficiency in AI/ML, it does not show significant practical application or impact. Additionally, there is no information about the scope or outcome of these projects.

Relevance (6/10): Alex's current education and course of study are relevant to the field of Information Technology, particularly IT related to AI/ML. However, their limited experience and skillset may not make them an ideal candidate for high-level roles in this field without further development or practical application.

Overall (5.2/10): Based on the provided information, Alex Johnson's profile shows potential but lacks significant experience or achievement to be highly competitive in the AI/ML industry. Their skills are relevant, but their limited experience and impact in their projects may not make them stand out from other candidates with similar education. To improve their profile, Alex should consider gaining more practical experience through internships or projects, as well as expanding their skillset beyond just Java and Deep Learning.
